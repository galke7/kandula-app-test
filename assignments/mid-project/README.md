# Coding Assignments - Mid Project
For the Mid project, we will start working on the initial bussiness logic of Kandula!

>**NOTE:** We remind you that each of the assignments need to be submitted on Github using the [OpsSchool home assignment flow](https://github.com/ops-school/docs/blob/main/home-assignments-submission-guide.md).

1. **Fork** the Kandula repo at: https://github.com/ops-school/kandula-app-9
2. Implement all TODO in the following files:
   * `Dockerfile` - main build functionality needs to be implemented
   * `app_health.py`  - only `check_aws_connection` method
   * `instance_data.py`  - functionality needs to be implemented
3. Open a Pull request for review (only on your own repo! not the parent repo!) add your assigned code reviewer to get code review. 


# RTFM! RTFM! RTFM! RTFM! RTFM!

* Kandula has a [detailed README file](https://github.com/ops-school/kandula-app-9). make sure you go over in full!
* PLEASE DO NOT CREATE A PULL REQUEST TO THE PARENT REPO! each student only merges code to their **own forked repo**.
